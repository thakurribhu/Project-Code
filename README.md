1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for short-term cryptocurrency price prediction and a trading strategy based on the model's recommendations.

1.1 Goals:

Apply machine learning techniques (including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models) to predict cryptocurrency price movements.
Evaluate the suitability of different algorithms for this task.
Utilize various labels and features, incorporating predictions from external APIs.
Design and back-test a trading strategy using the developed model on unseen data.
Implement a notification system (potentially email alerts) to inform users about predicted price movements in their chosen cryptocurrencies.
2. Problem Statement

The volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets necessitates the development of accurate prediction models. This project seeks to address this by creating a system that can predict future cryptocurrency prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy, enabling investors to make informed investment decisions.

3. Getting Started

3.1 Prerequisites:

Python (version X.Y or higher recommended)
Machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Data analysis libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy)
Additional libraries may be required depending on specific implementations (details to be added later)
